# This repository has been made to be used as a prepratory reference for coding interviews.

I have made my best efforts to put up here all algorithms here with simplest implementation .

***If any algorithm can be implemented in a better way or with an improved time complexity , fork the repository and commit the necessary changes and make a pull request . ***

I will heartly accept it :)
